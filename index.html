  <h2 class="h2"> 10 Year Plan</h2>
<p class='p1'> For the next ten years, I'd like to accomplish a lot of things. To begin with, I want to graduate from high school with honors. I want to attend one of Florida's top institutions and graduate with honors. not just to be proud of myself, but also <span>to be my father's pride and joy</span>. Start working in a job where I can make a decent living. To be able to travel throughout the world and learn about different places and cultures, not just for myself but also for my family. To be able to purchase a home and a car, as well as adopt a puppy. Being able to spoil my family by purchasing items for them and taking them for walks and meals. Above everything, I want to be happy.</p>

    <p class='p2'>I plan to attend the <span>University of Florida</span>, which is one of Florida's top colleges. I'd like to study engineering since I enjoy mathematics and other aspects of the field, but I'm not sure which branch I want to pursue. I'll find it soon with the support of my dad. I'll graduate high school in two years and then go to college for four years to complete my degree.</p>

  <p class='p3'> To attain my objectives, I must put up a <span>strong effort in all I do</span> and refuse to give up despite any obstacles. Every time I solve an issue, I try to develop my problem-solving abilities. Engineering appeals to me because it combines science and math to solve issues. Engineers are the ones who put new ideas into practice. Engineers:</p> 
   <ul class="list">
		<li> Design</li>
		<li> Develop and improve</li>
		<li> Operate and maintain complex equipment</li>
		<li> Structures</li>
    <li> Systems</li>
    <li> Processes by employing scientific concepts and inventions</li>
	</ul> 
<p class='p4'>Engineers live in a middle-class environment. Salaries vary by branch. You can, however, climb if you put in the work.</p>
